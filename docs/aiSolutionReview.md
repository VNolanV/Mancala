## Review of Text-Based Mancala Game: Created By AI

I gave the popular text based AI Chat GPT a simple prompt asking it to create a
text based version of the Mancala board game and it delivered a compilable/runnable
java file. However, in terms of how well it the program represents the actual game, it
does so very poorly.

That's not to say that it didn't do it job well in some respects. For one, the AI did use
and follow common coding conventions and formatting standards. The names that it also came up
for the programs classes and other relevant portions of code were also found to be very
meaningful and descriptive. This can be seen by just looking over the code itself. We can see 
that the AI spaced out the code and gave appropriate names to different parts of the code
which, at a glance can tell the viewer quickly what the code it represents is supposed to do.

The AI also did make an effort to properly encapsulate its classes and did this through the usage
of accessor/mutator methods and with the appropriate variables being listed as private. There is
also little to no duplication of code present in the provided file and all of the methods, classes
and objects that it created ech have their own unique and responsibilities.
